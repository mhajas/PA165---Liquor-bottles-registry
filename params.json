  "tagline": "Project developed as part of PA165 Enterprise Java - course at Faculty of Informatics Masaryk University.",
  "body": "### Idea\r\nEverybody knows why prohibition went into effect in Czech Republic some time ago. In order to prevent this in the future there is a need for liquor bottles registry. Such a registry would keep track of all the liquor bottles that are, or will be, on the market. For each bottle there is a need to keep record of its producer.\r\n\r\nAllow customer/store/lab (anyone) to mark bottle as toxic by entering taxStampID of the bottle to the system. The customers are interested in how many bottles of which liquor type are currently in particular stores. Police can obtain the statistics of the toxic bottles for each store and producer.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nrkv@mail.muni.cz\r\n",
